Bard,"I'm incredibly interested in joining the Principals team. My background in community management, education, and AI has uniquely prepared me as the best candidate for this position.   Education : I have a master's degree in Second Language Pedagogy from the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. While pursuing this degree, I taught Spanish for two years as a graduate teaching assistant at UALR. After graduating, I moved to the University of Central Arkansas where I taught in the Intensive-English Language Program (IELP) for another two years.   While working at Market Meditations (see resume), I was the primary author of a digital finance textbook. This project was part of a pilot program being considered by the Miami Dade school district for inclusion as highschool curriculum.   A.I. I'm constantly working with AI (mostly GPT-4 and 4o) to generate content, manage schedules, and conduct research. I'm particularly interested in the creation of AI agents and prompt engineering. I also really enjoy integrating and automating GPT using the OpenAI API, python, and Zapier.   Discord: As a Discord user of 8 years, I've very familiar with every aspect of the program. I have experience managing and growing Discord communities of various sizes, including being the administrator for the LandX server with over 10,000 members. I've written custom bots for community initiatives and directed several campaigns that directly contributed to a sold-out TGE in December of this year.   My portfolio can be found at https://krum.gitbook.io I have no doubt that I would overdeliver in this position.   I look forward to speaking with you.   Have a great day!",Discord Architect
